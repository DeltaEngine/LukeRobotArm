## Getting Started

1. **Use PlatformIO in VSCode**
2. **Configure WiFi**
   - Either use WifiAutoConnect to host an AP, connect to it and set your Wifi password or for testing edit 'src/main.cpp' and set your WiFi SSID and password.
3. **OTA Updates**
   Once connected to WiFi, future uploads can use OTA via --upload-port <device-ip>
